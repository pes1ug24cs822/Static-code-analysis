# Static Code Analysis Lab - Inventory System

## Description
This project is part of a static code analysis lab focused on improving the quality, security, and style of a Python inventory management system. Using tools such as Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8, common issues in Python code are identified and fixed to enhance maintainability and robustness.

## Features
- Inventory management with functions to add, remove, and check stock
- Persistent data storage using JSON files
- Input validation to prevent invalid types and negative stock values
- Use of static analysis tools to enforce coding standards and security

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pylint for code quality and style enforcement
- Bandit for security vulnerability detection
- Flake8 for style and formatting checks
- GitHub Codespaces for cloud development environment

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces or your local environment.
3. Install required tools if running locally:


## Running the Inventory System
Run the main Python script to see the inventory system in action:


## Running Static Analysis Tools
Run the following commands to analyze the code and find issues:

Fix issues based on the generated reports.

## Key Improvements Implemented
- Type and value validations to ensure data integrity
- Removed unsafe code usage such as `eval`
- Adopted best practices like context managers for file operations
- Applied PEP 8 naming and documentation standards
- Prevented negative stock values
